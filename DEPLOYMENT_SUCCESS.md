# 🎉 DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS IN PROGRESS

## ✅ Problems Solved:
1. **React 19 + Stripe Compatibility** - Added `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true`
2. **Import Path Errors** - Fixed broken relative imports in `layout.tsx`
3. **Directory Structure** - Removed duplicate `marketing-site/` folder
4. **Build Configuration** - Next.js project now properly structured at root

## 🚀 Current Status:
- **Next.js Build**: ● Building (3+ minutes) - EXCELLENT PROGRESS!
- **Previous Failures**: 6-8 seconds (now fixed!)
- **Dashboard**: ✅ Working at `app.sreentimejourney.com`

## 📍 What's Happening:
Your Next.js marketing site is successfully building on Vercel! 
Builds typically take 3-5+ minutes for complex Next.js apps.

## 🌐 Expected Results:
- **Marketing Site**: Will be live at `screentimejourney.com`
- **Dashboard**: Already working at `app.sreentimejourney.com`
