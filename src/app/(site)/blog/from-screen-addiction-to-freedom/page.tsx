              <h2>Recognizing Screen Addiction</h2>

              <h2>Common Challenges and Solutions</h2>
              <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> "I need my phone for work"</p>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Separate work functions from entertainment. Use app timers and create specific work-only modes.</p>

              <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> "I get anxious without my phone"</p>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Start with short periods of separation and gradually increase. Practice breathing exercises during anxiety spikes.</p>

              <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> "I'm bored without screens"</p>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Boredom is healthy—it's your brain's signal to engage in creative or meaningful activities.</p>
