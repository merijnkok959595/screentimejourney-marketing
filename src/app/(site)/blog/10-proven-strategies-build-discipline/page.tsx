              <h2>Building Unbreakable Discipline</h2>
              <p>Discipline isn't about willpower—it's about creating systems and environments that make good choices automatic. Here are 10 proven strategies to build lasting discipline.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Strategy 1: Environment Design</h2>
              <p>Make bad habits impossible and good habits inevitable by controlling your environment. Remove temptations and place beneficial tools within easy reach.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Strategy 2: The Two-Minute Rule</h2>
              <p>When starting a new habit, scale it down to something that takes less than two minutes. "Read before bed" becomes "read one page." Small wins build momentum.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Strategy 3: Habit Stacking</h2>
              <p>Link new habits to existing ones: "After I pour my morning coffee, I will meditate for 2 minutes." Use established routines as anchors for new behaviors.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Strategy 4: Implementation Intentions</h2>
              <p>Be specific about when and where you'll act: "When I feel the urge to check social media, I will do 10 pushups instead." Plan for obstacles before they arise.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Strategy 5: Tracking and Measurement</h2>
              <p>What gets measured gets managed. Use simple tracking methods to monitor your progress and celebrate small wins daily.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Strategy 6: Accountability Systems</h2>
              <p>Share your goals with others and create consequences for not following through. Social pressure can be a powerful motivator when used correctly.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Strategy 7: Energy Management</h2>
              <p>Align difficult tasks with your natural energy peaks. Most people have higher willpower in the morning—use this to your advantage.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Strategy 8: Identity-Based Change</h2>
              <p>Focus on who you want to become, not what you want to achieve. "I am someone who uses technology intentionally" is more powerful than "I want to use my phone less."</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Strategy 9: Progressive Overload</h2>
              <p>Gradually increase the difficulty of your discipline challenges. Like physical exercise, your willpower muscle gets stronger with progressive training.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Strategy 10: Recovery Protocols</h2>
              <p>Plan for setbacks and have a clear protocol for getting back on track. One mistake doesn't erase all progress—resilience is part of discipline.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
              <p>Choose 2-3 strategies that resonate most with you and implement them consistently for 30 days. Master the basics before adding complexity.</p>
